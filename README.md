# nvim-config
My nvim config with the gruvbox, nvim-lspconfig and more. (Edited config of jdh https://github.com/jdah/dotfiles)

NOTE: This config uses packer. Make sure to install it from https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim.

Put all the folders and files in your .config/nvim folder and run:

```
nvim +PackerSync
```

Now it should work. Open an Issue if you have any.
